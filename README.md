# json-api
Lets see what will come from it. This should solve problem with keeping the backend & frontend API in sync. This is for node backends, as it requires TypeScript on both side, as this seems the only reasonable solution for now. JSON is an obvious choice as a fromat. 

Events from frontend->backend whould use a standard JSON requests, but events backend->frontend need some more sophisticated web-socket solution.
